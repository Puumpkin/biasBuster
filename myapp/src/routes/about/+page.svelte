				<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> What is Questionnaire Bias?</h2>
				<p>
					Questionnaire bias is a type of bias, as implied in the name, that is found in surveys and
					questionnaires. It can appear from the way a question is worded or designed that can lead
					one to make a certain decision. There are many different types of questionnaire bias, such
					as, social desirability bias, acquiescence bias, question order bias, leading questions,
					and doubled-barreled questions. All of these can create a question that can lead the
					person answering to respond to the question in a certain way.

				<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Common Types of Questionnaire Bias</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Social Desirability Bias</b> is when the person answering the question wants to answer in
					a way that is socially acceptable. This can lead to the person answering the question to answer
					in a way that is not true to their actual beliefs. This can be seen in questions that ask about
					sensitive topics, such as, drug use, sexual activity, or other topics that may be seen as taboo.
					This can also be seen in questions that ask about a person's political beliefs. The person
					answering the question may not want to answer in a way that is not socially acceptable, so
					they may answer in a way that is not true to their actual beliefs. This can lead to a bias
					in the data that is collected from the survey or questionnaire.

				<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> How to create the perfect question.</h2>
				<p>
					When writing questions, you want to try and spot and avoid anything that could create
					avoid leading or double-barreled questions. Using a variety of question formats, such as
					open-ended questions and closed-ended questions, can make it, so you eliminate some
					potential bias. Make sure the question clear and concise as to eliminate any room for bias
					and create a simple question that won't confuse any respondents.
