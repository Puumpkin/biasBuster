			 What is Questionnaire Bias? 
		</h2>
		<p>
			Questionnaire bias is a type of bias, as implied in the name, that is found in surveys and questionnaires. It can appear from the way a question is worded or designed that can lead one to make a certain decision. There are many different types of questionnaire bias, such as, social desirability bias, acquiescence bias, question order bias, leading questions, and doubled-barreled questions. All of these can create a question that can lead the person answering to respond to the question in a certain way.
