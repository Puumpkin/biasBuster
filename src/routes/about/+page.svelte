				<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" /> What is Questionnaire Bias?</h2>
				<p>
					Questionnaire bias is a type of bias, as implied in the name, that is found in surveys and
					questionnaires. It can appear from the way a question is worded or designed that can lead
					one to make a certain decision. There are many different types of questionnaire bias, such
					as, leading questions, and doubled-barreled questions. All of these can create a question
					that can lead the person answering to respond to the question in a certain way.

				<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" /> Common Types of Questionnaire Bias</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Leading questions:</b> These are questions that are worded in a way that suggests the
					desired answer. For example, “Don't you think that our product is the best on the market?”
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Loaded questions:</b> Questions that are worded in a way that implies a particular
					point of view. For example, “Have you stopped mistreating your pet?” Implies that you have
					been mistreating your pet.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Double-barreled</b> questions: These are questions that ask two things in one. For
					example, “Do you think that our company is doing a good job of providing quality products
					and services at a reasonable price?” This has two questions, so you might agree with one
					but not the other.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Ambiguous questions:</b> These are questions that are unclear or difficult to
					understand. For example, “Did you enjoy it?” It is unclear what the question is referring
					to.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Vague questions:</b> These are questions that are too general or broad. For example,
					“How satisfied are you with your experience?” This is a very broad question you see in a
					lot of surveys, especially with restaurants.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Technical questions:</b> These are questions that require specialized knowledge to
					answer. For example, “What is your opinion on the shift to Wayland from X11?” Most people
					have no idea what Wayland or X11 is and would be unable to answer and just give a response
					that sounds correct and isn't how they feel if they knew about Linux display server
					protocols.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Personal questions:</b> These are questions that are too personal or intrusive. For example,
					“How much money do you make?” People might not feel comfortable sharing that and give a random
					amount that isn't how much they really make.

				<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" /> How to create the perfect question.</h2>
				<p>
					When writing questions, you want to try and spot and avoid anything that could create
					avoid leading or double-barreled questions. Using a variety of question formats, such as
					open-ended questions and closed-ended questions, can make it, so you eliminate some
					potential bias. Make sure the question clear and concise as to eliminate any room for bias
					and create a simple question that won't confuse any respondents.
